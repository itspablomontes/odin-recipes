    <p>Skip the store-bought mix and make this one-bowl chocolate cake from scratch. It's almost as easy as the boxed stuff, but it's so much more delicious.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>¾ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup boiling water</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round baking pans.</li>
        <li>Stir sugar, flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Add eggs, milk, oil and vanilla; mix for 2 minutes on medium speed with an electric mixer.</li>

        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 30 to 35 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
